Findings from training on 30th July, 2021.

Model 4 - {SAC, Mean squared} - off track for all 5 laps, on right edge, failed to take the right turn at the end
Model 3 - {SAC, Huber} - off track for 4 laps, failed to take the right turn at the end
Model 2 - {PPO, Mean squared} - On track for 4 laps, a bit slow
Model 1 - {PPO, Huber} - On track for all 5 laps, super slow

Functions to optimize for Model 1 - 
	1. goes zig-zag a lot during straight lines.
	2. speed is less for even straight lines.
	3. speed and steering angle action space to be optimized.
	4. hyperparameters to be tried and tested.
