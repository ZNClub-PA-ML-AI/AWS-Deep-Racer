Findings from training on 30th July, 2021.

Model 4 - {SAC, Mean squared} - off track for all 5 laps, on right edge, failed to take the right turn at the end
Model 3 - {SAC, Huber} - off track for 4 laps, failed to take the right turn at the end
Model 2 - {PPO, Mean squared} - On track for 4 laps, a bit slow
Model 1 - {PPO, Huber} - On track for all 5 laps, super slow

Functions to optimize for Model 1 - 
	1. goes zig-zag a lot during straight lines.
	2. speed is less for even straight lines.
	3. speed and steering angle action space to be optimized.
	4. hyperparameters to be tried and tested.


Findings from training on 31st July, 2021. (finalized model 1 for further optimization)

Model 1-4 - {action space change, changed threshold angle} - off track for 3 laps.
Model 1-3 - {action space change, changed stay straight rewards} - off track for 1 lap, min speed - 26s 
Model 1-2 - {action space change, learning rate 10^-5} - 40s
Model 1-1 - {action space change} - superfast but 95%, 17 secs

Findings from training on 1st August 2021.

Model 1-3-clone - {clone of 1-3} - off track for 1 lap, min speed - 26s.
Model 1-1-3 - {action space speed 1.5}, default, off track for all 5 laps
Model 1-1-2 - {action space speed 1.5}- SPEED_THRESHOLD_FAST, rewards, grad batch size - 128 - off track, eliminated 
Model 1-1-1 - {action space speed 1.5}- SPEED_THRESHOLD_FAST, rewards - 87%, 12 secs, all tracks

Findings from training on 1st August 2021. (finalized model 1-1-1 for further optimization)

Model 1-1-1-4 - {discrete - new car, find_curve function change} - error
Model 1-1-1-3-1 - {Model 1-1-1, discrete - new car, lr -> 10^-3} - 1 lap completed in 14 secs, rest off track
Model 1-1-1-2 - {clone of Model 1-1-1}, grad batch size - 32 - 5 laps completed in 13.3 secs, best model so far
Model 1-1-1-1 - {clone of Model 1-1-1} - 5 laps completed in 13 secs, second best model till date, gogo is proud of himself.

1. rewards 
2. action space - speed {car} - min speed at 2m/s , stay straight - 4/5;

4 versions
  1. Model 1-1-1-2 clone
  2. Change rewards /thresholds
  3. car - min speed - 2 - new model
  4. TBD
